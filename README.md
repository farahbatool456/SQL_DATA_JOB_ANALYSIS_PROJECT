### 2. Skills for Top-Paying Jobs

Joined job postings with skills data to identify what employers value in high-compensation roles.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT	
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```

**Skill Frequency in Top 10 Paying Jobs**

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Skill Count Across Top 10 Paying Data Analyst Jobs"
    x-axis ["SQL", "Python", "Tableau", "R", "Snowflake", "Pandas", "Excel", "Power BI", "AWS", "Azure"]
    y-axis "Number of Jobs (out of 10)" 0 --> 10
    bar [10, 9, 8, 5, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2]
```

**Skill breakdown by category:**

| Category | Skills | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 🔵 Core languages | SQL, Python, R | Appear in 50–100% of top roles |
| 🟢 Visualization | Tableau, Excel, Power BI | Tableau dominates at 8/10 |
| 🟡 Cloud / Infra | AWS, Azure, Snowflake, Oracle | Growing relevance at senior level |
| 🔴 Python libraries | Pandas, NumPy | Common in ML-adjacent roles |
| ⚫ Dev / Collab tools | Jira, Confluence, Atlassian, Bitbucket | Cluster in engineering-adjacent roles |

**Key takeaways:**

INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = True 
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

### 5. Most Optimal Skills to Learn

Combined demand and salary data to identify skills that are both widely requested and well-compensated — the best ROI for skill development.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills_dim.skill_id,
    skills_dim.skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count,
    ROUND(AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = True 
GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skill_id

**Top Optimal Skills Ranked by Salary**

| Skill | Demand Count | Avg Salary ($) |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Go | 27 | $115,320 |
| Confluence | 11 | $114,210 |
| Hadoop | 22 | $113,193 |
| Snowflake | 37 | $112,948 |
| Azure | 34 | $111,225 |
| BigQuery | 13 | $109,654 |

| Java | 17 | $106,906 |
| SSIS | 12 | $106,683 |
| Jira | 20 | $104,918 |

**Key takeaways:**

- **Cloud tools are the sweet spot:** Snowflake (37 postings, $113K), Azure (34, $111K), and AWS (32, $108K) offer a strong combination of demand and salary
- **Python and R are high-demand but not the highest-paid** — demand counts of 236 and 148 respectively, with avg salaries around $101K. They're expected, not differentiating.
- **Tableau and Looker** (demand: 230 and 49) sit around $99K–$104K — critical for business intelligence roles
- **Database technologies** (Oracle, SQL Server, NoSQL) remain relevant at $98K–$104K

## What I Learned

Throughout this project, key SQL skills were developed and applied:

- 🧩 **Complex query crafting** — multi-table JOINs, CTEs (`WITH` clauses), and subqueries
- 📊 **Data aggregation** — `GROUP BY`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, and `HAVING` filters
- 💡 **Analytical thinking** — translating business questions into structured SQL logic

## Conclusions

### Key Insights

| # | Insight |
|---|---------|
| 1 | **Top-paying roles:** Remote data analyst salaries range from $184K to $650K at the top end |
| 2 | **Skills for top pay:** SQL is the most critical skill for high-compensation roles |
| 3 | **Most in-demand:** SQL leads all skills in raw job posting volume by a large margin |
| 4 | **Highest-paying skills:** Niche tools like PySpark and DevOps skills (GitLab, Bitbucket) command a salary premium |
| 5 | **Optimal skills:** Cloud platforms (Snowflake, Azure, AWS) offer the best balance of demand and salary |

### Closing Thoughts

The data is clear: **SQL is non-negotiable**, Python and Tableau are baseline expectations at the top of the market, and cloud skills are the most strategic next investment. Chasing every skill on this list is not the answer — the data does not reward breadth. Focus on the high-demand, high-salary intersection and build from there.
